= Rails: simple example howto add/update :has_many :through using nested forms

This example app setups a simple association :through. I created a nested form to add and update the 3 models. Actually there's not a lot there. But reading the documentation didn't made it clear how it all worked 'together'. For this reason I needed to play around little bit
